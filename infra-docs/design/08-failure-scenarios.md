# Homelab & Development Infrastructure – Failure Scenarios

## Document Context

This document defines **expected failure scenarios and system behavior** within
the homelab and development infrastructure.

It builds on:

- `00-overview.md`
- `01-architecture.md`
- `02-node-roles.md`
- `03-networking.md`
- `04-storage.md`
- `05-container-strategy.md`
- `06-security-boundaries.md`
- `07-backup-recovery.md`

This file documents **what may fail and what must survive**, not how failures
are resolved.

## Failure Design Philosophy

Failures are expected and planned for.

The architecture assumes:

- Individual components will fail
- Hardware is replaceable
- Services must be recoverable

The goal is **controlled failure**, not failure avoidance.

## Acceptable Failures

The following failures are considered acceptable and recoverable:

- Development workstation failure
- Individual container failure
- Monitoring service failure
- Access node failure

These failures must not result in permanent data loss.

## Unacceptable Failures

The following outcomes are unacceptable:

- Loss of authoritative service data
- Cascading failure across node boundaries
- Recovery requiring undocumented steps
- Single failure causing total system loss

If these occur, the design must be revisited.

## Node-Level Failure Scenarios

### Lyra Failure

- Impact: Development temporarily unavailable
- Expected Outcome: Rebuild or replace without data loss
- System Impact: None on runtime services

### Proxima Failure

- Impact: Services unavailable
- Expected Outcome: Services restorable from backups
- System Impact: Temporary loss of availability only

### Nova Failure

- Impact: Reduced access convenience
- Expected Outcome: No recovery required
- System Impact: None

### Rhea Failure

- Impact: Media and file access unavailable
- Expected Outcome: Isolated recovery
- System Impact: No effect on development services

## Service-Level Failure Scenarios

- Individual service container failure must not affect others
- Monitoring failure must not affect core services
- Experimental services must fail silently without impact

Service failures are isolated by design.

## Data Failure Scenarios

- Ephemeral data loss is acceptable
- Persistent data loss is unacceptable
- Backup corruption must be detectable

Data integrity is prioritized over service continuity.

## Failure Detection Expectations

Failures should be:

- Observable
- Detectable
- Understandable

Silent failures are treated as design flaws.

## Summary

The system is designed to:

- Fail in isolated ways
- Preserve authoritative data
- Recover predictably

A system that fails clearly is easier to operate than one that fails silently.
