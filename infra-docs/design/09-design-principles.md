# Homelab & Development Infrastructure – Design Principles

## Document Context

This document defines the **core principles that guide all design and
operational decisions** in the homelab and development infrastructure.

It builds on all previous documents:

- `00-overview.md`
- `01-architecture.md`
- `02-node-roles.md`
- `03-networking.md`
- `04-storage.md`
- `05-container-strategy.md`
- `06-security-boundaries.md`
- `07-backup-recovery.md`
- `08-failure-scenarios.md`

This file serves as the **philosophical foundation** for consistency,
predictability, and maintainability.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns

- Each node and container has **one primary responsibility**
- Overlap is explicitly avoided
- Isolation prevents accidental interference

### 2. Explicit Boundaries

- Trust, storage, and access boundaries are clearly defined
- Containers, services, and nodes respect their limits
- Violations require documented decisions

### 3. Docker-First, LXC-Isolated

- Docker is the standard runtime
- LXC containers isolate persistent services
- VMs are avoided unless explicitly justified

### 4. Predictable Lifecycle

- Containers and services follow **create → promote → operate → retire**
- Development and runtime are decoupled
- Lifecycle rules reduce human error

### 5. Data Authority

- Persistent data lives only where it is owned
- Compute nodes are disposable
- Backups exist to recover authoritative data only

### 6. Minimal Host Complexity

- Hosts run only what they must
- Development hosts are ephemeral
- Runtime hosts avoid direct service execution outside containers

### 7. Security Through Scope

- Exposure is minimized
- Internal trust is enforced by boundaries, not by complex tooling
- Access is intentional and role-based

### 8. Observability & Monitoring

- Monitoring is isolated from production services
- Failure visibility is prioritized over uptime illusions
- Experimental workloads never compromise observability

### 9. Predictable Failure

- Failures are expected, isolated, and recoverable
- Unknown failure modes are design flaws
- Recovery is designed before problems occur

### 10. Documentation & ADR-Driven Changes

- All architectural changes are documented
- ADRs govern deviations and exceptions
- Knowledge lives in written form, not memory

## Summary

The homelab is designed to be:

- Predictable
- Maintainable
- Scalable without chaos
- Easy to recover
- Secure by isolation and boundaries

Adherence to these principles ensures a **stable, reliable, and professional
development environment**.
