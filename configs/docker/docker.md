# Homelab - Docker setup

Below is a cleaned, corrected, and properly ordered Docker installation and setup procedure for Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, with errors fixed, inconsistencies removed, and best practices applied. I also explain what was wrong and why it is fixed, but concisely.

### 1.Reconfigure Timezone (Optional but Recommended -proxmox)

```

sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

```

#### 2. System Update & Base Packages

#### 3. (Optional) Create a Dedicated Non-Root User for Docker

### 4. Add Docker Official Repository (Correct Method)

### 5. Install Docker Engine & Tools

### 6. Create Docker Group & Add User

### 7. Enable and Start Docker

### 8. Docker Directory Layout (Before daemon.json)

### 9. Docker Daemon Configuration

### 10. Verify Docker Installation (Sanity Check)
